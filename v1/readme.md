#Attempt at making TDD more exiting by trying it in Go and using switch statement.

Fizzbuzz prints and return an array of any size you pass to it, not only 100.
When the integer is divisible by 3 it prints "Fizz"
When the int is divisible by 5 it prints "Buzz"
when the int is divisible by 3 and 5 it prints "FizzBuzz"
